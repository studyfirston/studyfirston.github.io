## Conclusion
Conclusion: 
Throughout this semester, we want to build an application - AI-Fitness Friend -
that can check a user's body posture. As people accelerate more into more digital
forms of fitness guide, our application is expected to become more increasingly
relevant. Users can use their computer or smartphone camera to
recognize their exercise postures and movements, while this app can guide you
through the correct postures with voice helpers. Whether your fitness goals are to build muscle, get toned or lose weight fast, Ai-Fitness Training will be the simplest way to do fitness training exercises.
